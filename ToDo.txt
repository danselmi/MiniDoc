
to fix:
Update preview
- deleting lines is not catched.


Open points:
A) Suggestions:
    3. use even smaller font for larger files
    4. it would be good if the space between the lines could be made smaller, so more text could be made visible.
-> size of font can not be minimized further.

C) MicroView
   - add other graphical infos from editor to MicroView
   - sync
