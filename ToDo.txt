
to fix:
Update preview
- after resize of main view will resize 2nd splitted view which gets not catched atm.
- deleting lines is not catched.

Default Marker
Scintilla doc: "By default, all 32 markers are set to SC_MARK_CIRCLE with a black foreground and a white background."
Solution to check:
- PrepareMainView() will make the marker invisible in the main view.
  Dont' know when a second control gets created.
- Make default marker invisible in core. At least the unused [0..22]




Open points:
A) Suggestions:
    3. use even smaller font for larger files
    4. it would be good if the space between the lines could be made smaller, so more text could be made visible.
-> size of font can not be minimized further.

B) bug in wxScintilla: border around every line with marker

C) add other graphical infos from editor to MicroView
