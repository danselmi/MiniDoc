to fix:
- sync(Update) MiniDoc
  - deleting lines is not catched correctly

- sync MicroView
  - sync seems to work better with splitted editor. Why?


Open points:
A) Speed
   it feels slow??
B) Suggestions:
    - use even smaller font for larger files
    - it would be good if the space between the lines could be made smaller, so more text could be made visible.
    -> size of font can not be minimized further.
	-> it is not that bad as it is IMHO.

C) MicroView
   - add other graphical infos from editor to MicroView

D) C::B
how to manage the usage of the indicators and markers? Is it needed?
MiniStyledTextCtrl has to follow changes in different plugins to "mimic" cbEditors control colors.
(incremental search and highlighter)
Changing their configuration needs a restart of MiniDoc plugin to become colored the same.
Any plugin can "use" any marker/indicator number.
